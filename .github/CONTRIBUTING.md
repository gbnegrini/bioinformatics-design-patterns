# Contribution guide

Thank you for considering contributing to Bioinformatics Design Patterns! Through the help of the community, we aim to create resources to help bioinformatics developers. :woman_technologist: :man_technologist: :dna:

## Before contributing, consider this

Please be kind and respectful to others at all times. We explicitly forbid harassment, abusive speech and any types of discrimination. We expect contributors to communicate professionally and thoughtfully.

## How to submit design patterns

If you want to submit a new language or library of patterns, do the following:

1. Use the folder `language-library-template` inside `patterns` as a template for a language/library. Just copy and rename it.
2. Use the `pattern-template` folder and `pattern-template.md` file as templates of patterns inside the language/library. The file is where you write the pattern and the folder (with the same name) is where you place the images you reference in the file.
3. Create an author profile to reference yourself in the pattern file. Please use `content/authors/contributor_example` as template.
4. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/gbnegrini/bioinformatics-design-patterns/pulls) with the new files. Select the New pattern PR template.

## How to report bugs

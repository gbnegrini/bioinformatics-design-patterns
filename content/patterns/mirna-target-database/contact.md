## Overview

![](contact.png)

## Problem

Users need to contact the team responsible for maintaining the tool.

## Context

The answers to the user's questions are not always found in the interface. Furthermore, if the user finds an issue or has a suggestion, a form of **Contact** must be made available for communication to take place.


## Solution

Dedicate a page to list ways to contact the tool maintainers. Contact can be made available by simply listing e-mails or using a contact form. The types of contact appreciated (e.g., bug report, suggestion, questions) should be described.


## Rationale

The experience of using the tool can be undermined when the user encounters a problem or has a unanswered question. **Contact** allows issues to be resolved by bridging the gap between user and developer. Additionally, **Contact** can enable users to keep the database [**Status and Statistics**]({{< relref "patterns/mirna-target-database/status-and-statistics" >}}) up to date by submitting suggestions or updates.
